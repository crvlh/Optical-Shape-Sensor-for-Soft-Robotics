### Research paper 
Optical Fiber Macro-Bend Sensor for Shape Monitoring in Flexible Structures

### Overview
This repository presents a fiber optic sensor-based approach for monitoring deformations in flexible structures, with a focus on soft robotic systems. The sensor utilizes macrobend-induced variations in optical intensity to track structural deformations, enabling real-time shape sensing. The methodology involves preprocessing optical transmission spectra using dimensionality reduction techniques, training predictive models through Bayesian parameter optimization, and evaluating model performance for shape monitoring.

### Methodology
The methodology involves preprocessing optical transmission spectra using PCA to reduce computational complexity. Bayesian parameter optimization is employed for training predictive models, followed by a grid search to select optimal hyperparameters. This ensures efficient shape monitoring while maintaining computational simplicity.
